"""core/contracts.py -- source of truth for every data shape that crosses a module boundary.

This file is the contract between sim/, disturbance/, tracking/, control/, ui/ and
telemetry/. Never change a dataclass here without updating every consumer in the same
task and calling it out explicitly.

Units convention (applies to every field in this file):
    - angles ........ radians
    - lengths/dists . meters
    - time .......... seconds
    - pixel coords .. integer pixels, origin at the TOP-LEFT of the image
    - image data .... uint8, BGR, shape (height, width, 3), row-major (numpy default)
